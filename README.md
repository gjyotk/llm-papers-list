# llm-papers

## Overview

Each week, I set out to explore, reflect on, and document my learnings from one LLM-based research paper. This journey is a personal effort to stay connected with the latest developments, deepen my understanding of Machine Learning, and share my insights with others who share this passion. I'll use this repository as a space to chart my progress, with heartfelt summaries, challenges addressed by the papers, and links to any related blogs or discussions that resonate with me.

## Papers List

Below is the list of most relevant foundational papers on LLMs (according to me) that I've curated from Latent Space's 2025 Papers list (https://www.latent.space/p/2025-papers#%C2%A7section-frontier-llms) and suggested reading materials from the course "Generative AI with Large Language Models" by Deeplearning.ai on Coursera:


- **Title:** Improving Language Understanding
by Generative Pre-Training
**Reference:** (Radford, Alec. "Improving language understanding by generative pre-training." (2018).)
